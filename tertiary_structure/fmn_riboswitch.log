### Step-by-step Process

**Step 1: Input Validation**
- Secondary structure provided by user
- Validation completed successfully

**Step 2: Fragmentation of Secondary Structure**
- Identified 7 stems (D1–D7), 8 loops (L1–L8), and 5 single strands (SS5p, SS1–SS3, SS3p)

**Step 3: 3D Structure Elements Preparation**
- Structures selected based on homologous elements from PDB:
  - e.g. Stem D1 matched to 3FTM with 100% homology
  - e.g. Loop L1 matched to 2ZJR with 80% homology

**Step 4: Rigid Body Transformations and Merging**
- All fragments assembled into 3D model successfully

**Step 5: Initial Torsion Angle Minimization**
- Completed without issues

**Step 6: Cartesian Space Energy Minimization**
- Progressive energy improvements during 1000 cycles:
  - Etotal improved from -842.430 → -2224.511
  - Gradients and structural strain reduced across bonds, angles, van der Waals, electrostatics, etc.

**Final Output**
- MODEL 1 successfully generated and refined
- Total composition time: 23 seconds

Final minimized energy (Cycle 1000):
- Etotal = -2224.511
- Grad(E) = 1.295
- E(BOND)=24.584  E(ANGL)=336.991  E(IMPR)=47.261
- E(VDW)=-1670.487  E(ELEC)=-983.607
- E(NOE)=1.126  E(PLAN)=19.622
